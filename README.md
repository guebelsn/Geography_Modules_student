# Geography_Modules_student

This repo is a first draft to include data science modules in Geography courses as part of the curriculum. The notebooks are meant to be student assignments for lower-division Geography courses. Students do not have to have programming experience. This is a way to expose them to coding while covering core topics in the Geography courses.
